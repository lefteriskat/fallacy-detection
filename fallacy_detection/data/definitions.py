    "Appeal To Emotion: attempting to arouse non-rational sentiments within the intended audience in order to persuade.",
    "False Causality: occurs when someone mistakenly assumes that because one event follows another, the first event caused the second, without sufficient evidence for a causal link.",
    "Ad Hominem: The opponent attacks a person instead of arguing against the claims that the person has put forward.",
    "Faulty Generalization: A generalization is drawn from a sample which is too small, it is not representative of the population or it is not applicable to the situation if all the variables are taken into account.",
    "False Dilemma: Presenting two alternative options as the only possibilities, when in fact more possibilities exist. As an the extreme case, tell the audience exactly what actions to take, eliminating any other possible choices (Dictatorship).",
    "Fallacy of Relevance: The argument supporting the claim diverges the attention to issues which are irrelevant for the claim at hand.",
    "Fallacy of Credibility: happens when someone argues that a claim is true simply because an authority or expert believes it, even if that authority is not a reliable or relevant source on the topic.",
    "Ad Populum: A fallacious argument which is based on affirming that something is real or better because the majority thinks so.",
    "Circular Reasoning: A fallacy where the end of an argument comes back to the beginning without having proven itself.",
    "Fallacy of Extension: An argument that attacks an exaggerated or caricatured version of your opponentâ€™s position.",
    "Equivocation: An argument which uses a key term or phrase in an ambiguous way, with one meaning in one portion of the argument and then another meaning in another portion of the argument.",
    "Deductive Fallacy: An error in the logical structure of an argument. ",
    "Intentional Fallacy: Some intentional (sometimes subconscious) action/choice to incorrectly support an argument.",
